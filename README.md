# Electric Vehicle Data Visualisation Project

This repository showcases a data visualization project focused on Electric Vehicle (EV) registration data. The goal is to use visual storytelling to uncover trends, patterns, and insights in EV adoption across regions, manufacturers, and vehicle types.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Transform raw EV registration data into clear, insightful visualizations
- Identify market leaders, geographic adoption hotspots, and EV type trends
- Communicate data-driven stories using charts and graphs

---

## 📊 Key Visuals and Techniques

- **Bar Charts** – Top manufacturers and EV types
- **Pie Charts** – Distribution of vehicle categories
- **Line Charts** – Year-wise growth in registrations
- **Heatmaps / Geoplots** – Regional EV concentration (if included)
- **Grouped Plots** – Model year vs. vehicle count, city-wise breakdown
